"win_ties.json" is a file here that ties the images in "./images/win/" and "./images/lose/" to a respective sound.
This is to play goofy sounds whenever the image randomly appears.
However, this can break very easily if you do anything wrong: something as little as misplacing a comma will break it.
Be very careful touching it.
